A command-line tool for automatically detecting vendored and copy/pasted code between repositories.

## Description üßë‚Äçüéì

Vendetect helps identify copied or vendored code between repositories, making it easier to detect when code has been copied with or without attribution. The tool uses similarity detection algorithms to compare code files and highlight matching sections.

Key features:
- Compare code between two repositories (local or remote)
- Identify files with similar code and display them side-by-side
- Show similarity percentages for matched code
- Support for different programming languages through Pygments lexers
- Similarity is _not_ solely based upon symbol names; vendetect also considers semantics

## Installation üöÄ

### Using pip

```bash
pip install vendetect
```

### From source

Clone the repository and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/vendetect.git
cd vendetect
pip install .
```

### Development installation

For development with all dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/vendetect.git
cd vendetect
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage üèÉ

### Basic usage

```bash
vendetect TEST_REPO SOURCE_REPO
```

Where:
- `TEST_REPO`: Path or URL to the repository you want to check for copied code
- `SOURCE_REPO`: Path or URL to the repository that is the potential source of the code

### Example

```bash
# Compare two local repositories
vendetect /path/to/my/project /path/to/another/project

# Compare a local project with a remote repository
vendetect /path/to/my/project https://github.com/example/repo.git
```

### Options

```
--log-level LEVEL  Sets the log level (default=INFO)
--debug            Equivalent to --log-level=DEBUG
--quiet            Equivalent to --log-level=CRITICAL
```

## How it works üßê

Vendetect uses a combination of techniques to identify similar code:

1. It fingerprints all source code files in both repositories based upon their semantics rather than syntax
2. For each file pair, it computes a similarity score
3. It identifies specific sections (slices) of code that match between files
4. Results are presented in a rich output format with side-by-side comparison

The tool can handle:
- Local file system repositories
- Git repositories (with history support)
- Remote git repositories (automatically cloned for analysis)

## Requirements üõí

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git (optional, for repository history analysis)
